# Electronic-Store-Datawarehouse

The ever-evolving landscape of electronic retail demands robust and efficient data management systems to support critical business operations and insightful decision-making. In response to this need, our project embarks on the design and development of a comprehensive database for an electronic store, laying the foundation for a streamlined and analytics-ready information architecture.


1. Data Cleaning
In the initial phase, we diligently address the intricacies of raw data, employing rigorous data cleaning techniques to rectify inconsistencies, eliminate errors, and standardize formats. Our objective is to ensure the integrity and quality of the data, laying the groundwork for subsequent phases of the project.


2. Normalization
Building on the principles of database normalization, we structure the dataset to adhere to higher standards of organization and reduce redundancy. This involves breaking down tables into smaller, related entities, achieving a clean and logically structured database schema. The normalization process follows recognized forms such as 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF to create a robust and efficient data model.


3. ERD Design
With a normalized dataset in hand, we proceed to design an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). This visual representation captures the entities, relationships, attributes, and keys essential to the electronic store's operational and analytical aspects. The ERD serves as a blueprint for the subsequent stages of database development.


4. Data Warehouse Modeling
Taking a strategic leap toward business intelligence and analytics, we transform the normalized ERD into a data warehouse model. The star schema architecture is adopted, featuring dimension tables for descriptive attributes and fact tables for measurable, numeric data.
